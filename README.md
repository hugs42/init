# init - 42

## About

This first network project, init, offers the opportunity to discover system and network basic commands, many of the services used on a server machine, as well as a few ideas of scripts that can be useful for SysAdmins on a daily basis.

This project is proposed by the slash16 team. Slash16 is a network of people who are passionate about system and network administration and/or operations development (DevOps).
